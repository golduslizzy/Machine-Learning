## Contents

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Data cleaning, encoding, scaling, and dataset splitting.

2. **Regression**  
   - Simple Linear, Multiple Linear, Polynomial Regression, and more.

3. **Classification**  
   - Techniques such as Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, and Decision Trees.

4. **Clustering**  
   - Methods including K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.

5. **Association Rule Learning**  
   - Techniques like Apriori and Eclat.

6. **Reinforcement Learning**  
   - Basics of Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound.

7. **Natural Language Processing**  
   - Text cleaning, Bag-of-Words, and sentiment analysis.

8. **Deep Learning**  
   - Neural network fundamentals with examples using Keras and TensorFlow.

9. **Dimensionality Reduction**  
   - Techniques like PCA, LDA, and Kernel PCA.

10. **Model Selection & Tuning**  
    - Cross-validation, Grid Search, and Random Search.
